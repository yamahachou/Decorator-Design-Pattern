# Decorator-Design-Pattern
Implementation of Decorator Design Pattern

Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

Example: => Pizza need to have multiple add on it, so we create interface called pizze and then add Cheese, Bacon on it.
